# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To design UML diagrams for a Student Enrollment System to model its structure and functionality.

# SRS (Procedure):

# 1. Class Diagram
Identify classes with attributes and methods.

Define relationships (association, generalization, aggregation).

Use class boxes and connectors.

# 2. Use Case Diagram
Identify actors and use cases.

Draw actors outside, use cases inside the system boundary.

Connect actors to use cases; use <<include>>, <<extend>> if needed.

# 3. Activity Diagram
Identify activities, decisions, start and end nodes.

Use flow arrows, decision diamonds, and activity boxes.

Represent process flow clearly.

# 4. Package Diagram
Group related classes into packages.

Draw packages using folder-like symbols.

Show dependencies between packages with dashed arrows.

# 5. Sequence Diagram
Identify objects and message sequence.

Draw lifelines vertically.

Use horizontal arrows for messages (in order from top to bottom).

Show activation bars if needed.

# 6. Communication Diagram
Identify objects and interactions.

Represent objects as boxes connected by lines.

Label messages with sequence numbers and direction arrows.
